    <section>
        <h2>Scientific and Alternate Names</h2>
        <p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong> N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)</p>
        <p><strong>Alternate Names:</strong> Dimethylnitrosamine, N,N-Dimethylnitrosoamine</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Chemical Structure</h2>
        <img src="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imgsrv.fcgi?cid=6124&t=l" alt="NDMA Chemical Structure">
        <p><strong>Chemical Formula:</strong> C₂H₆N₂O</p>
        <p><strong>Boiling Point:</strong> 151°C</p>
        <p><strong>Water Solubility:</strong> 290 g/L at 25°C</p>
        <p>NDMA is highly volatile and disperses easily in air and water, making it persistent in the environment.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Uses and Exposure</h2>
        <p>NDMA is widely found in the environment due to natural and industrial processes. It is a byproduct of water disinfection using chloramines, leading to contamination in drinking water.</p>
        <p>It is also present in processed foods such as cured meats, smoked fish, and alcoholic beverages like beer and whiskey. NDMA contamination in pharmaceuticals has led to recalls, including drugs like ranitidine and valsartan.</p>
        <p>Other sources include tobacco smoke and industrial emissions from rubber and chemical manufacturing plants.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Physical and Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>NDMA's chemical properties contribute to its toxicity. Its high water solubility makes it difficult to remove from contaminated sources. The compound is highly reactive and can easily form carcinogenic byproducts.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Health Effects</h2>
        <p>NDMA is a potent hepatotoxin and carcinogen. The liver is the primary target organ, where NDMA metabolism leads to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and increased cancer risk.</p>
        <p>It is linked to liver, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers. Acute exposure at high doses can lead to severe liver necrosis, while chronic exposure, even at low levels, increases the likelihood of tumor formation.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Mechanism of Toxicity</h2>
        <p>Once absorbed, NDMA is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2E1, in the liver. This process generates highly reactive intermediates, such as methyl diazonium ion, which can bind to DNA and proteins.</p>
        <p>DNA adduct formation, specifically O6-methylguanine, interferes with normal replication, leading to mutations, chromosomal instability, and potential tumor formation.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Scientific Research</h2>
        <p>Studies in rodents show that NDMA exposure leads to rapid hepatocellular necrosis and the formation of liver tumors. The LD₅₀ (oral, rats) is 30–40 mg/kg.</p>
        <p>Chronic exposure to as low as 1 mg/kg/day for months has resulted in liver tumors, lung cancer, and kidney damage in rodents. Human epidemiological studies associate long-term exposure (0.1–10 ppb in water) with increased liver cancer rates.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Regulations</h2>
        <p>Due to its high carcinogenic potential, NDMA is heavily regulated. The EPA has set a drinking water limit of 0.7 ng/L, while the FDA has enforced strict controls on pharmaceutical contamination.</p>
        <p>Despite regulatory efforts, ongoing industrial pollution and dietary sources continue to pose risks.</p>
